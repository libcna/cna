# CNAEXT engine layer (`CNA::Graphics`)

## Status

The **CNAEXT engine layer** is the opt-in `CNA::Graphics` namespace that sits *above* CNA's XNA 4.0
API and orchestrates frame-level work the XNA 4.0 contract has no concept of: an HDR render
pipeline, post-processing passes, shadow maps, skybox/IBL, and (long term) compute.

It is **early**. As of 2026-08-17 the layer contains only the pieces listed under *What exists
today* below — a settings bag, a material description, three renderer-neutral post-process effects,
and their enumerations. The orchestration half (`RenderPipeline`, `BloomPass`, `ShadowMap`,
`Skybox`, `EnvironmentProcessor`, `ComputeShader`, …) is **designed but not implemented**; do not
describe it as available. Its design is [`../CNAEXT.md`](../CNAEXT.md) and its task backlog is
[`../plan_modern.md`](../plan_modern.md).

Enable it with:

```bash
cmake --preset cnaext          # == -DCNA_GRAPHICS_RENDERER=OPENGLES3 -DCNA_CNAEXT=ON -DCNA_BUILD_TESTS=ON
cmake --build --preset cnaext --target CnaTests
```

`CNA_CNAEXT` defaults to **OFF**. With it off, every header of this layer declares nothing at all,
so an XNA 4.0 port cannot accidentally depend on it.

## The two things called "CNAEXT"

| | `CNAEXT` marker convention | `CNA_CNAEXT` engine layer |
|---|---|---|
| What | The `CNAEXT` macro (`CNA/CNAHelper.hpp`) and the `*EXT` name suffix | A CMake option gating the whole `CNA::Graphics` namespace |
| Compiled | **Always** — a documentation/lint marker, never a compile guard | **Opt-in** — everything is inside `#ifdef CNA_CNAEXT` |
| Lives in | `Microsoft::Xna::Framework::…`, beside the XNA types it extends | `CNA::Graphics` |
| Examples | `PbrEffect`, `SkinnedPbrEffect`, `ShaderEffect`, `MorphTargetDataEXT` | `RenderPipelineSettings`, `PbrMaterial`, `DepthEffect`, `CRTEffect` |

The rule: a per-object/per-draw shading extension that takes the shape of an XNA `Effect`, vertex
format, or `GraphicsDevice` member ships as an always-compiled `CNAEXT` member. Frame-level
orchestration that pulls in extra render targets and GPU memory lives in the gated engine layer.

## What exists today

| Type | Header | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `RenderPipelineSettings` | `CNA/Graphics/RenderPipelineSettings.hpp` | Configuration bag (HDR, exposure, gamma, tonemapping, bloom, SSAO, quality, shadows). **No consumer yet** — `plan_modern.md` Phase 7 builds it. |
| `TonemappingMode`, `RenderQuality`, `ShadowQuality` | same directory | Enumerations used by the settings bag. |
| `PbrMaterial` | `CNA/Graphics/PbrMaterial.hpp` | Serialization-friendly PBR material description. |
| `DepthEffect` (+ `DepthEffectMode`, `DitherMode`) | `CNA/Graphics/DepthEffect.hpp` | Colour-depth-reduction post-process (RGB565/RGB332, 4/2/1-bit greyscale, palettes, ordered dithering). |
| `CRTEffect` (+ `CRTMaskType`) | `CNA/Graphics/CRTEffect.hpp` | Scanlines, RGB sub-pixel mask, barrel curvature, vignette. |
| `AsciiPostProcessEffect` (+ `AsciiQuantizeMode`) | `CNA/Graphics/AsciiPostProcessEffect.hpp` | Renderer-neutral ASCII/glyph-grid post-process (see [`ascii-post-process-effect.md`](ascii-post-process-effect.md)). |
| `CNAEXT.hpp` | `CNA/Graphics/CNAEXT.hpp` | Master include — pulls in every public type above. |

## Conventions for this layer

These are the rules every `CNA::Graphics` type follows. They differ deliberately from the XNA layer,
which must instead match XNA 4.0 exactly.

- **Naming.** Verbs are `lowerCamelCase` (`apply`, `resize`, `begin`). Properties use
  `getX()`/`setX()`, or `isX()` for booleans — matching the existing `RenderPipelineSettings` and
  `PbrMaterial`. There is no XNA name to preserve here, so the C++ house style wins.
- **Guarding.** Every file in `modules/graphics-ext/{include,src}` opens with `#ifdef CNA_CNAEXT`
  and closes with `#endif // CNA_CNAEXT`. `scripts/check_cnaext_guards.sh` enforces this.
- **Documentation.** Full Doxygen (`@brief`, `@param`, `@return`) on every public member, exactly as
  CLAUDE.md requires of the XNA layer.
- **Renderer access.** Engine-layer code talks to the GPU only through `GraphicsDevice`, `Effect`,
  `RenderTarget2D`/`RenderTargetCube` and `IGraphicsRenderer` — never raw GL/VK/D3D.
- **Capability-gated, never crashing.** Each subsystem checks
  `GraphicsDevice::SupportsCapability()` and documents its fallback. No renderer is mandatory, and
  no subsystem may make one so.

## Per-renderer support matrix

The engine layer's subsystems are rolled out per renderer, exactly as the PBR effects were. This
matrix is authoritative and is updated by each task that changes a cell; a subsystem with no
implemented feature has no row yet.

The renderer identities are those of `CNA::GraphicsRendererType` (49 on `next`). Note that a build
can now contain several renderer families and pick one at run time
([`runtime-renderer-selection.md`](runtime-renderer-selection.md)), so engine-layer code asks the
live `GraphicsDevice` for a capability and never a compile-time `CNA_RENDERER_*` macro.

| Subsystem | EasyGL (reference) | Vulkan | D3D11 | Other renderers |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Post-process effects (`DepthEffect`, `CRTEffect`) | ✅ GLSL | ⬜ | ⬜ | `AsciiPostProcessEffect` is CPU-side and runs everywhere |
| Float/HDR render targets | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ |
| `RenderPipeline` + post-process passes | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ |
