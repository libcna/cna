# XNA 4.0 API Coverage Audit

**Date:** 2026-06-08  
**Reference:** FNA source at `/rv/data/library/github.com/FNA-XNA/FNA/src`  
**CNA headers:** `include/Microsoft/Xna/Framework/`

---

## 1. Overview

This document compares the CNA public C++ API surface against:

1. The FNA C# source tree, which is the primary faithful reimplementation of XNA 4.0.
2. The XNA 4.0 SDK documentation for areas that FNA omits (GamerServices, Avatar, etc.).

### Status Definitions

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Implemented** | Header + working `.cpp` implementation; passes tests or is exercised in demos. |
| **Partial** | Header exists; some public methods are missing, or behavior is incomplete. |
| **Stub** | Header + declaration exist; behavior throws `std::runtime_error` / returns a no-op default. Marked with `// CNA_STUB:` in source. |
| **Missing** | No header in CNA at all. |
| **Intentionally excluded** | Deliberately not ported; reason documented below. |

### What counts as "public XNA 4.0 API"

- `public` and `protected` members of non-internal classes/structs/enums in the `Microsoft.Xna.*` namespace.
- FNA-internal helper classes, platform backends, `internal` C# classes, and Xbox-Live–specific runtime classes that were never meaningful on PC are **excluded** from this audit.

## 2. Namespace Coverage

| Namespace | FNA has it | CNA has it | Status |
|-----------|-----------|------------|--------|
| `Microsoft::Xna::Framework` (root) | ✅ | ✅ | Implemented |
| `Microsoft::Xna::Framework::Audio` | ✅ | ✅ | Implemented / Stub |
| `Microsoft::Xna::Framework::Content` | ✅ | ✅ | Partial (see §3) |
| `Microsoft::Xna::Framework::Design` | ✅ | ❌ | Intentionally excluded (see §6) |
| `Microsoft::Xna::Framework::GamerServices` | ❌ (not in FNA) | ⚠️ | Stub – Guide only (see §5) |
| `Microsoft::Xna::Framework::Graphics` | ✅ | ✅ | Implemented / Stub |
| `Microsoft::Xna::Framework::Graphics::PackedVector` | ✅ | ✅ | Stub |
| `Microsoft::Xna::Framework::Input` | ✅ | ✅ | Implemented |

## 3. FNA Public API Found but Missing in CNA

### `Microsoft::Xna::Framework::Content`

| Missing class | Notes |
|---------------|-------|
| `ResourceContentManager` | Loads content from .NET assembly resources. CNA equivalent would load from embedded binary. **Should be stubbed.** |
| `ContentReader` | XNB binary stream reader used by stock ContentTypeReaders. CNA uses a file-extension reader approach, not XNB. **Intentionally deferred** – see §6. |
| `ContentTypeReaderManager` | Internal registry used by ContentReader. Not needed without XNB support. **Intentionally deferred.** |
| `ContentExtensions` | Adds `GetLoadedAssets()` extension to ContentManager. FNA-internal convenience; not core XNA 4.0 public API. **Intentionally excluded.** |
| `ContentSerializerAttribute` and siblings | Design-time attributes for the Content Pipeline build tool. Not a runtime concern. **Intentionally excluded** – see §6. |
| `LzxDecoder` | XNB LZX decompressor. FNA internal. **Intentionally excluded.** |

### `Microsoft::Xna::Framework::GamerServices`

FNA itself does not implement GamerServices. CNA has only `Guide` (stub).  
The following XNA 4.0 classes are absent from both FNA and CNA; they should exist as stubs
so that XNA 4.0 game code that references them can at least compile:

| Missing class | Notes |
|---------------|-------|
| `GamerServicesComponent` | `GameComponent` subclass that must be added to `Game.Components` to enable gamer services. **Should be stubbed.** |
| `GamerServicesNotAvailableException` | Thrown when gamer services calls are made on a platform that does not support them. **Should be stubbed.** |
| `Gamer` | Abstract base for `SignedInGamer` and `NetworkGamer`. |
| `SignedInGamer` | Represents a locally signed-in player profile. |
| `GamerCollection<T>` | Generic collection of Gamer objects. |
| `SignedInGamerCollection` | Indexed collection of locally signed-in gamers. |
| `GamerPresence` | Current presence information (what the player is doing). |
| `GamerPresenceMode` | Enum of presence modes. |
| `GamerPrivilege` | Enum of privilege flags. |
| `GameDefaults` | Static helper for reading default player settings. |
| `FriendCollection` | Collection of friend gamers. |
| `FriendGamer` | Represents a friend in the gamer's friend list. |

---

## 4. CNA API Present but Incomplete

### `Microsoft::Xna::Framework::Content::ContentManager`

- **Missing:** `ServiceProvider` property (`IServiceProvider*`). XNA 4.0 ContentManager takes a service provider in its constructor and exposes it. CNA uses `setGraphicsDevice()` instead. Any XNA 4.0 game that passes a service provider to ContentManager will not compile without this.
- **Missing:** Protected `OpenStream(string)` virtual — needed if subclasses want to intercept asset loading.
- **Missing:** Protected `ReadAsset<T>` — needed if subclasses customise loading.
- **Status:** Partial

### `Microsoft::Xna::Framework::Graphics::GraphicsDevice`

- All public methods are declared. Some behaviors are backend-dependent and may be no-ops.
- **Status:** Partial (functionally working for 2D and 3D; some query methods return stubs)

### `Microsoft::Xna::Framework::Graphics` — Stock Effects

- `BasicEffect`, `AlphaTestEffect`, `DualTextureEffect`, `EnvironmentMapEffect`, `SkinnedEffect`: headers exist with full API shape. GPU-side shader logic is stub/no-op for non-EasyGL backends.
- **Status:** Stub (API surface complete)

### `Microsoft::Xna::Framework::Graphics::PackedVector::*`

- All 13 packed vector types have headers. Most are API-only stubs without implementation.
- **Status:** Stub

### `Microsoft::Xna::Framework::Audio` — Stub classes

- `AudioEngine`, `SoundBank`, `WaveBank`, `Cue`: headers exist; XACT audio is unimplemented.
- `Microphone`, `DynamicSoundEffectInstance`: headers exist; backends are stub.
- `SoundEffect`, `SoundEffectInstance`: **Implemented** (SDL_mixer backend).
- **Status:** Partial

### `Microsoft::Xna::Framework::Input::Touch`

- `TouchPanel`, `TouchPanelCapabilities`, `TouchCollection`, `TouchLocation`, `TouchLocationState`, `GestureSample`, `GestureType`: headers exist.
- No SDL3 touch backend is wired up yet.
- **Status:** Stub

### `Microsoft::Xna::Framework::Media`

- `Song`, `SongCollection`, `MediaPlayer`, `MediaQueue`: implemented with SDL_mixer.
- `Album`, `Artist`, `Genre`, `Picture`, `Playlist` and their collections: stub.
- `MediaLibrary`: stub.
- `Video`, `VideoPlayer`: implemented (FFmpeg backend).
- **Status:** Partial

### `Microsoft::Xna::Framework::Storage`

- `StorageDevice`, `StorageContainer`, `StorageDeviceNotConnectedException`: headers exist with full XNA API shape. Behavior is implemented via native file-system calls.
- **Status:** Implemented

### `Microsoft::Xna::Framework::GamerServices::Guide`

- Single method `Show()` and `IsTrialMode` property exist.
- No other gamer-services classes exist.
- **Status:** Stub (minimal)

---

## 5. XNA 4.0 API Not Present in FNA

These classes were part of XNA 4.0 but FNA does not implement them (Xbox Live / Xbox 360 exclusive).  
They are listed here for completeness; CNA should expose stub declarations so XNA game code compiles.

### `Microsoft::Xna::Framework::GamerServices` (Xbox Live)

All classes listed in §3 under GamerServices fall here. FNA has no implementation for any of them.

### Avatar API

Xbox 360 avatar rendering API; not part of PC XNA 4.0 and never implemented by FNA.

| Class | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| `AvatarAnimation` | Avatar skeletal animation clip. |
| `AvatarDescription` | Describes avatar body/clothing. |
| `AvatarExpression` | Enum of facial expressions. |
| `AvatarRenderer` | Renders an avatar with BasicEffect-compatible matrices. |
| `AvatarUpdateParameters` | Parameters for per-frame avatar update. |

**Decision:** These are Xbox 360 exclusive. They will remain `// CNA_STUB: Xbox 360 specific. Not applicable on PC.` if ever added. For now they are **not planned**.

### Net — Xbox Live Networking

`Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Net` (NetworkSession, PacketReader/Writer, NetworkGamer, etc.) is an Xbox Live multiplayer API. FNA does not implement it and it has no PC equivalent. **Intentionally excluded from CNA.**

---

## 6. Intentionally Excluded or Deferred API

### `Microsoft::Xna::Framework::Design` — TypeConverter classes

FNA provides 13 TypeConverter subclasses (e.g. `BoundingBoxConverter`, `ColorConverter`) that integrate XNA math types with `System.ComponentModel.TypeDescriptor` for use in .NET design-time editors (Visual Studio property grid).

**Why excluded from CNA:**
- `System.ComponentModel` is a .NET-only framework; no C++ equivalent exists.
- CNA has no design-time editors.
- These classes have zero runtime value for game code.
- Implementing a `TypeConverter` abstraction in sharp-runtime solely for this purpose would add significant complexity for no benefit.

**Decision:** Permanently excluded. If ever revisited, a minimal `ITypeConverter` interface could be added to sharp-runtime with no-op converters.

### `Microsoft::Xna::Framework::Content` — XNB pipeline classes

CNA's `ContentManager` is not XNB-based. It uses file-extension readers instead of the XNB binary format.

**Excluded because of this design decision:**
- `ContentReader` (reads from an XNB stream)
- `ContentTypeReaderManager` (manages XNB type reader registrations)
- `ContentSerializerAttribute` and siblings (content pipeline build-tool attributes)
- `LzxDecoder` (XNB LZX compression)

**Deferred:**
- `ResourceContentManager` — loads from C++ embedded resources; no XNB needed. Should be stubbed as a subclass of `ContentManager` with a `// CNA_STUB:` comment.

### FNA-Internal Classes (excluded as non-XNA-4.0 API)

| Class | Reason |
|-------|--------|
| `FNA3D` | FNA private GPU backend |
| `PipelineCache` | FNA internal shader cache |
| `ProfileCapabilities` | FNA internal feature detection |
| `VertexDeclarationCache` | FNA internal |
| `DxtUtil`, `X360TexUtil` | FNA internal texture utilities |
| `EffectHelpers`, `EffectMaterial`, `Resources` | FNA internal effect helpers |
| `GestureDetector` | FNA internal touch gesture FSM |
| `FNALoggerEXT` | FNA-specific logging extension |
| `BaseYUVPlayer`, `IVideoPlayerCodec`, `VideoPlayerAV1`, `VideoPlayerTheora` | FNA internal video codec backends |
| All `FNAPlatform/*`, `Utilities/*` | FNA platform glue |

## 7. Recommended Implementation Order

1. **Math / common framework types** — ✅ Done: Color, Vector2/3/4, Matrix, Quaternion, BoundingBox/Sphere/Frustum, Ray, Plane, Curve, MathHelper, Point, Rectangle, GameTime.

2. **Input** — ✅ Done: GamePad, Keyboard, Mouse, Touch (stubs).

3. **Audio** — ✅ Partial: SoundEffect/Instance done. XACT (AudioEngine/SoundBank/WaveBank/Cue) remains stub.

4. **Graphics 2D** — ✅ Done: SpriteBatch, Texture2D, SpriteFont, BlendState, RasterizerState, SamplerState.

5. **Graphics 3D** — ✅ Partial: VertexBuffer/IndexBuffer, Model, BasicEffect, DrawInstanced. PackedVector types and some stock effects remain stubs.

6. **Content / Media / Storage** — ✅ Partial: ContentManager (file-extension approach), MediaPlayer, VideoPlayer done. `ResourceContentManager` stub needed.

7. **GamerServices / Platform stubs** — ⚠️ Only `Guide` stub exists. `GamerServicesComponent` and `GamerServicesNotAvailableException` should be added for compile-compatibility.

## 8. Summary

### What was added by this audit

- `docs/xna-4-api-coverage.md` (this file)
- `include/Microsoft/Xna/Framework/Content/ResourceContentManager.hpp` — stub
- `src/Microsoft/Xna/Framework/Content/ResourceContentManager.cpp` — stub
- `include/Microsoft/Xna/Framework/GamerServices/GamerServicesComponent.hpp` — stub
- `src/Microsoft/Xna/Framework/GamerServices/GamerServicesComponent.cpp` — stub
- `include/Microsoft/Xna/Framework/GamerServices/GamerServicesNotAvailableException.hpp` — stub

### What remains missing

- `Design` namespace TypeConverter classes (intentionally excluded)
- `GamerServices` rich API (Gamer, SignedInGamer, etc.) — stubs can be added on demand
- `ContentReader` XNB-based class (deferred; CNA uses non-XNB approach)
- `ContentSerializerAttribute` family (intentionally excluded)
- XACT audio system (AudioEngine, SoundBank, WaveBank, Cue) — headers exist, behavior is stub

### What is intentionally excluded

- `Design` namespace — requires `System.ComponentModel` which has no C++ equivalent
- `ContentReader` and XNB pipeline — CNA uses file-extension approach, not XNB
- Avatar API — Xbox 360 exclusive
- Xbox Live Networking (`Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Net`) — Xbox Live exclusive
- All FNA-internal implementation classes

### Build status

See build run in task notes. Build must remain clean after each stub addition.

### Recommended next steps

1. Add compile-compatibility stubs for `Gamer` / `SignedInGamer` / `GamerCollection` if target games need them.
2. Implement XACT audio (AudioEngine, SoundBank, WaveBank) via SDL_mixer or OpenAL.
3. Wire up SDL3 touch backend for `TouchPanel`.
4. Complete PackedVector implementations (Pack/Unpack math).
5. Fix pre-existing `GamePadInputTest` axis scaling failure.
