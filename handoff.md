# handoff.md — current state of CNA

This file describes the repository as it is now and is kept true. Until 2026-10-11 it was `NEXT.md`
and also carried the dated session log of 2026-07 to 2026-10; that log is in Git history
(`git show 8b5564f1e:NEXT.md`).

**§5 is the one authoritative list of current known bugs and limitations.** No other file keeps a
live bug list: capability documents (renderer docs, `docs/gltf-limitations.md`,
`docs/gamer-services-known-limitations.md`, `CHECKLIST.md`'s accepted deviations) describe what a
subsystem does by design, not what is broken; tests are the executable evidence; the plans under
`plans/` and Git history keep the measurements and discovery history. When a bug is fixed, delete
its §5 entry in the same commit.

Last reconciled against the code and a full test run: **2026-10-14** (`next`).

## 1. Project summary

CNA is a C++23 reimplementation of the XNA 4.0 programming model (`Microsoft::Xna::Framework`) on a
CNA-owned platform abstraction (SDL3 by default) and a curated set of graphics renderers. FNA's
source is the day-to-day behavioural reference; where FNA and XNA disagree, XNA wins (`CLAUDE.md`).

The project is leaving its AI-driven feature-expansion phase for long-term maintenance by a human
C++ developer. The renderer set, the platform layer and the content formats are deliberately kept as
they are: no new renderers, asset formats, graphics engines or subsystems. Work from here is fixing
§5, keeping behaviour faithful to XNA, and keeping validation deterministic.

## 2. Current status

**Renderers.** 10 public identities over 8 implementation families — `OPENGLES3`, `OPENGL33`,
`WEBGL2`, `WEBGPU`, `HEADLESS`, `SOFTWARE`, `STUB`, `DIRECTX9`, `SDL_GPU`, `FNA3D`; the three GL
identities share the internal EasyGL implementation. `SDL_GPU` is CNA's modern native path: SDL
owns its Vulkan, Direct3D 12 and Metal backends. The canonical list is
`cmake/RendererIdentities.cmake` (held to the C++ enum and the C ABI by
`scripts/check_renderer_identities.py`); the table with gates and factories is
[`docs/renderer-registry.md`](docs/renderer-registry.md). 41 identities are retired — `VULKAN`,
`DIRECTX11`, `METAL` and `SDL_RENDERER` on 2026-10-13 — and refused by name at configure time and at
run time; their reserved ABI values are in [`docs/removed-renderers.md`](docs/removed-renderers.md).
Do not add or restore a renderer without an explicit owner decision.

**Graphics layer.** Every renderer implements one contract, `IGraphicsRenderer`, for XNA graphics
plus CNA's graphics extensions (SPIR-V/GLSL/WGSL `ShaderEffect` with vertex/fragment
`ShaderPackageEXT`, PBR and skinned PBR, image-based lighting, shadow reception, float render
targets, instancing, compiled effects, `Texture3D`/`TextureCube`). There is no
second, general-purpose GPU layer underneath: the compute-shader, storage-buffer/image,
texture-array, memory-barrier, indirect-draw and GPU-timer abstractions were retired end to end on
2026-10-13 (`plans/plan_modern_retirement.md`), including their common interfaces, backend
implementations, capability/limit identities, C API routes and tests. `modules/graphics-ext/`
remains (`docs/cnaext-engine-layer.md`).

**Platforms.** `CNA_PLATFORM` is `SDL3` (default; Windows, X11, Wayland, macOS, iOS, Android and the
browser are all reached through SDL3's drivers), `HEADLESS`, or POSIX-only `TERMINAL`. CNA's own
`WIN32`/`X11`/`WAYLAND` backends were retired on 2026-10-06 and are refused by name.
`CNA_AUDIO_PLATFORM` is `SDL3`, `NULL` or `ALSA`. Evidence differs per target:

| Target | What is actually verified |
|---|---|
| Linux x86_64 | Everything; this is where the suites run. |
| Windows | MinGW-w64 cross builds run under Wine: `DIRECTX9` through DXVK, `SDL_GPU`'s Direct3D 12 backend through vkd3d-proton, `SOFTWARE`; the manual MSVC workflow builds and runs the `DIRECTX9` suite and, since RRC-051, an `SDL_GPU` Direct3D 12 smoke leg (`scripts/ci/run-sdlgpu-smoke.sh`; not run yet, the workflow is manual). No real-Windows hardware validation is current (§5.2). |
| Web (Emscripten) | `WEBGL2` and `WEBGPU` builds run in Chrome (`docs/web-emscripten-graphics-limitations.md`). |
| Android | `OPENGLES3`, the default there, on an x86_64 emulator; `SDL_GPU` on Android is not qualified (`docs/android-graphics-limitations.md`). |
| macOS / iOS | macOS CI builds CNA with `SOFTWARE` and runs the portable platform suites and a bundle smoke app, and (gating, since RRC-051, not run yet) builds `SDL_GPU` and runs its smoke set on SDL's Metal backend; iOS is a `SOFTWARE` simulator smoke app, with non-gating `SDL_GPU` legs. `SDL_GPU` is the default on both but is not re-qualified there (§5.2, `docs/apple-platforms.md`). |

**XNA API surface.** Every public type and every documented member of the Microsoft XNA 4.0 runtime
reference is represented; the generated census is
[`docs/xna-4-runtime-member-coverage.md`](docs/xna-4-runtime-member-coverage.md)
(`python3 tools/audit_xna_runtime_surface.py --write-reports`). Representation is not behaviour:
behavioural fidelity is held by each module's tests. One member is deliberately left unimplemented
(§6).

**Bindings.** C and C# are the maintained bindings. CNA.NET (`libcna/cna-dotnet` `develop`) admits
exactly C ABI 0.47.0 and pins one CNA `next` commit (`CNA_UPSTREAM_COMMIT` in its
`.github/workflows/build.yml`); its CI builds and loads the native library from that commit. CNA
`next` is ABI 0.48.0 since the 2026-10-13 renderer retirement (four renderer constants removed, no
route changed); CNA.NET names none of them and must admit 0.48.0 before it moves its pin. CNA
`main`/`develop` are the v0.1.0 release (ABI 0.46.0), which CNA.NET refuses. The archived bindings in
`cna-lab` stay pinned to older ABIs and are not maintained.

**Content.** XNB readers (including LZX), CNA's `.cnb`/`.cnj`, direct glTF 2.0 loading, the
`cna-content` build tool and the XNA Content Pipeline façade: `docs/content-pipeline.md`,
`docs/xna-content-pipeline-parity-report.md`, `docs/gltf-limitations.md`. No further formats are
planned.

**Tests.** GoogleTest under CTest; `ctest -N` in a build tree gives its count. Latest full Debug
runs, 2026-10-17 at the end of the handoff 5.1 stabilization pass (branch `stabilization`, worktree
`cna-stab`), through the private runner on RADV: `cmake-build-multi` (`OPENGLES3` default with
`OPENGL33`, `WEBGPU`, `SDL_GPU`, `FNA3D`, `SOFTWARE`, `HEADLESS`, `STUB`; C API) 11,433 tests, 1
failed (`EasyGL_Conformance_render_target_own_msaa`, §5.3), 195 skipped;
`cmake-build-sdlgpu` 11,284, none failed, 256 skipped; `cmake-build-webgpu` 10,964, none failed, 256
skipped; `cmake-build-software` 10,982, none failed, 101 skipped; `cmake-build-fna3d` (its OpenGL
driver) 10,806, 2 failed, 400 skipped -- `ContentPipelineCliTest.ContentBuildGraphReportsALongCycleDeterministically`
and `Sdl3InputTest.MouseReadsThePointerBesideTheWindowAsXnaDoes`, which pass alone (three of three);
the second reads the pointer of the private display that parallel tests also move, and failed the
same way once in an earlier SOFTWARE run. Under Wine, `cmake-build-mingw` (Release, `DIRECTX9` with
DXVK 2.6.0): `CnaGraphicsTests.exe` in eight shards 2,688/2,688, and the `DIRECTX9` ctest suite
59/59 without `DirectX9_CompiledEffects` (§5.3); with DXVK 3.1.1 the whole suite 60/60, twice.
`cmake-build-headless` was not re-run. Every run excluded `XnaPipelineGenuineRuntime` and
`XnaDifferentialBuildTest` (Wine-hosted XNA builds), which §7 says to run outside the private
runtime. CI: `general-tests-ci.yml` runs the unfiltered suite for
`OPENGLES3` and fails on a dirty checkout; the other workflows are subsystem- or platform-specific.

## 4. Working rules for this phase

- Fix defects, do not add surface. A fix comes with a focused regression test.
- Never run tests on the live desktop: use `tools/platform/run_gpu_tests_private.sh`.
- A test may write only to its build tree or a temporary directory. `scripts/check_clean_checkout.sh`
  enforces that a validation run leaves tracked files unchanged.
- Build into the existing `cmake-build-<variant>/` trees with ccache; do not create one-off build
  directories (`CLAUDE.md`, "Build locations & caching").

## 5. Known bugs and limitations

The single authoritative list. The stabilization pass of 2026-10-16/17 fixed or removed every
reproduced CNA defect that was on it; an entry says when it was last measured.

### 5.1 Defects

- **`SpriteSortMode::Immediate` is batched on `SDL_GPU` and `WEBGPU`** (low priority). Both accept
  the mode but defer its sprites, so a texture changed between two `Draw` calls of one Immediate
  batch shows its new contents in both sprites. XNA draws each Immediate sprite with the state and
  texture contents current at its `Draw`, so the first keeps the old contents. `OPENGLES3`
  (EasyGL), `SOFTWARE` and `FNA3D` do. Reproducer: `EasyGL_SpriteBatch_SortModeSemantics` (on
  `SDL_GPU` also `SdlGpu_CrossFamily_SpriteBatch_SortModeSemantics`, elsewhere the same program
  with `CNA_GRAPHICS_RENDERER`); the test passes, and leg B's `[INFO]` line prints blue/blue where
  XNA gives red/blue. Reproduced 2026-10-17.

### 5.2 Limitations

- `SDL_GPU` ignores `BlendState.MultiSampleMask`: the pinned SDL (3.4.0 headers) reserves
  `SDL_GPUMultisampleState::sample_mask`/`enable_mask`, so the mask reaches the renderer and is
  deliberately not applied; `ColorWriteChannels` is honoured.

- `BoundingFrustum::Intersects(Ray)` throws `System::NotImplementedException` for the case it does
  not compute — reserved for the human author, see §6.
- Native `SurfaceFormat::Alpha8` render-target storage is unavailable on every renderer:
  `GraphicsDevice::SupportsSurfaceFormatAsRenderTargetEXT(SurfaceFormat::Alpha8)` is false, and a
  render target preferring Alpha8 falls back to `Color` as XNA's preferred-format rule allows
  (`GraphicsCapabilityFloatRenderTargetTests.cpp`). Alpha is kept; the one-byte-per-pixel storage
  is not (`Color` is four). How the Xbox 360 allocated an Alpha8 target was never captured.
- Online sessions and invitations are native-only; a browser build refuses them explicitly
  (`docs/browser-network-readiness.md`, `docs/gamer-services-known-limitations.md` §26).
- `DIRECTX9` is validated under Wine (+DXVK) only, and `SDL_GPU`'s Direct3D 12 backend under Wine
  (+vkd3d-proton) only; real-Windows hardware validation is not current. The C API's pure-C suites
  run under Wine from the MinGW-w64 build; `MediaLibrarySmoke` reports a skip on Windows, whose
  known folders cannot be pointed at its fixture. The MinGW-w64 test binaries also skip on
  Windows what it cannot provide: a Python interpreter where none can be started, `/dev/full`,
  aging a directory through `utime`, symbolic links, a renderer without 3D, and the ordering guard
  for tests that need an uninitialized `GamerServicesDispatcher`.
- **`SDL_GPU` is the default renderer on Windows, macOS and iOS but is not qualified there** since
  the 2026-10-13 retirement of `DIRECTX11` and `METAL` (`docs/removed-renderers.md`). Evidence that
  exists: the full tree passed with `SDL_GPU` (Metal backend) on a Mac mini M4 in the AM4 campaign,
  before the retirement; Direct3D 12 runs under Wine. Not done: a native Windows (Direct3D 12) run,
  a re-run on Apple hardware, and any iOS build (`SDL_GPU` has never been built for iOS; CI tries it
  as a non-gating leg). Known gaps against the retired native backends, each to be implemented or
  capability-gated in that campaign: `ShaderEffect` (`CustomEffects`) is compiled out on Windows,
  Apple and the browser because no runtime GLSL-to-SPIR-V-to-DXIL/MSL path exists; occlusion queries
  are unavailable (SDL_gpu 3.5 has none). `RendererFeature::BaseInstanceDrawing` is implemented by
  `SDL_GPU` since RRC-043 (its stock, instanced-matrix and compiled-effect routes expand per-instance
  streams on the host from the first instance); no other survivor claims it.
- iOS has simulator smoke evidence only, with `SOFTWARE`.
- `WEBGPU` is supported (promoted from experimental on 2026-10-17) and verified on Linux x86_64
  and in headless Chrome only; its Windows, macOS and linux-aarch64 wgpu-native packages are
  unverified (`WEBGPU-1`, `plans/plan_webgpu.md`).
- `SOFTWARE` is a bounded CPU renderer, and `HEADLESS` and `STUB` make no pixel claim
  (`docs/renderer-registry.md`, "Capability classes").
- Per-subsystem capability boundaries, by design rather than defect, are in the documents listed
  in §3.
- In a `CNA_SHARED_LIBRARY=ON` tree, `CMAKE_LINK_DEPENDS_NO_SHARED` (`CMakeLists.txt`) keeps the
  executables from relinking when `libcna.so` changes. After a commit that changes a class layout
  or a vtable, the executables linked before it run against a library they were not linked for
  (the loader warns `Symbol ... has different size in shared object`) and fail for no reason of
  their own; delete and relink them before reading the suite. Seen on 2026-10-13 in
  `cmake-build-multi` after the link-boundary work's virtual-function additions: 237 bogus
  failures from 1,245 stale executables.

### 5.3 External and driver limitations

Behaviour CNA does not own, measured and reported rather than worked around.

- **Conformance programs on drivers and capability boundaries** (`*_Conformance_*`,
  `modules/graphics/examples/conformance/`, measured 2026-10-15/17):
  - EasyGL: a `RenderTarget2D` requested and applied at 2x resolves with no partially covered edge
    texel (`render_target_own_msaa` D); 4x resolves as expected, so this is the GL driver's 2x
    sample pattern meeting the probe's edge. It is the one failure of the `cmake-build-multi` run.
  - FNA3D: `SkinnedEffect.VertexColorEnabled` is ignored outright (B equals A) and saturates before
    the fold; its back buffer keeps a 3, 5 or 7 sample request unrounded while its render targets
    round it down; `GraphicsDeviceManager`'s default `Depth24` request is not applied in
    `graphics_adapter_query`. FNA3D's driver owns those answers.
  - SDL_GPU and DIRECTX9: cube faces in a multi-render-target set are refused with
    `System::NotSupportedException` while `MultipleRenderTargets` is true (`cube_mrt_binding` M1-M4
    and the plural cube-face `RenderTargetSemantics` cases skip on that refusal); HEADLESS accepts
    them. A capability boundary.
- **`DIRECTX9` under Wine with DXVK 2.6.0: `DirectX9_CompiledEffects` hangs or aborts in DXVK's
  device teardown; DXVK 3.1.1 does not** (measured 2026-10-17, `cmake-build-mingw`, Release,
  `CNA_DIRECTX9_COMPILED_EFFECTS=ON`). Its 31 gtests were run 30 times on each version in one Wine
  prefix that differed only in the DXVK DLLs: 2.6.0 (Debian's package, `/usr/lib/dxvk`) failed 9 of
  30 -- hangs inside the first test, `CapabilityAndPublicRuntimeContract`, and `std::system_error`
  "Thread not joinable", a string of DXVK's own thread wrapper -- while 3.1.1 passed 30 of 30, and
  with it the whole `DIRECTX9` ctest suite passes 60/60 twice. On 2026-10-15 teardown markers had
  shown every renderer object released and the final `IDirect3DDevice9::Release` never returning.
  CNA was not changed for it. `scripts/run-wine-dxvk9.sh` still defaults to `~/.wine-cna-d3d11`,
  which links the system 2.6.0; `CNA_D3D9_WINEPREFIX=~/deps/wineprefix-cna-dxvk-3.1.1` selects a
  copy with 3.1.1 (machine-local, outside Git); the script's DXVK gate accepts the `v` official
  builds print before the version. `CnaGraphicsTests.exe` is run as eight
  `GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS` shards because one 2,956-test process under 2.6.0 dies or hangs at a varying
  point.

## 6. Reserved for the human author

- **`BoundingFrustum::Intersects(Ray)`** (`modules/math/src/BoundingFrustum.cpp`). It answers a ray
  whose origin is outside (`nullopt`) or inside (`0`) the frustum, and throws
  `System::NotImplementedException` in the remaining case. The owner reserved the real
  implementation as hands-on C++ work: do not implement it, generate it, or remove the exception.
  `BoundingFrustumTests.cpp` covers only the two answered cases.
- **Licence-header convention.** The tree carries 30 MIT and ~3,150 MS-PL SPDX headers, two
  `storage` source/header pairs with mismatched headers, and ~170 header-less `.hpp`/`.cpp` files
  (mostly examples). Which header CNA-original files carry, and whether `CNA::Internal::Net` stays
  MIT on purpose, is the owner's policy call; a one-line rule next to `CHECKLIST.md`'s header
  section and a lint would follow from it.

## 7. Build, test and environment

- GPU renderers are tested in their own trees (`cmake-build-sdlgpu`, `cmake-build-webgpu`,
  `cmake-build-multi`, …) through the same private runner. Never run several renderers' full suites at the same time: GPU and driver
  contention produces false failures.
- `CMakePresets.json` has the focused unit, sanitizer, web, Apple and multi-renderer presets.
- System packages for a fresh Debian machine: [`docs/development-environment.md`](docs/development-environment.md).
